# tonkasten

endless music box. wip.

## intent

a sonic atmosphere contained in a sealed box. turn it on, let it run and fill the room for as long as needed.

## resources

- [tech.md](tech.md) - list of all parts currently used for the prototype
- [music.md](music.md) - notes for musical generation
- [workshop.md](workshop.md) - workshop to build your own tonkasten

## thoughts and influences

- [buddha machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlSM3GMuYVU), for the product design
- erik satie's [vexations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexations), for the ability to repeat the same motif without boredom
- brian eno's generative music (made with [Koan](https://www.wired.com/1997/10/can-generative-music-carry-the-nets-tunes/), now rebranded as [Wotja](https://intermorphic.com/wotja/)), for the technical contribution
- [listen to wikipedia](http://listen.hatnote.com/), for the possible data visualization
- [brand new noise](https://www.brandnewnoise.com/), for the product design (without the interaction/instrument aspect)
- different modes? (morning, afternoon, night)
- one long-ass soundscape vs. recombinating segments
