# pogłos

endless music box. wip.

**pogłos**

1. an acoustic phenomenon consisting in the prolongation of sound, caused by the action of reflected waves in  a closed room
2. a multiplication of sound
3. a reference to something, especially in someone's work

## intent

pogłos is a generative sonic atmosphere contained in a wooden frame.

it is slightly bigger than an A4 piece of paper, and it consists of a a small computer, a switch, and a speaker. the switch turns on the computer, the computer starts generating an ever-evolving version of a musical composition, and the speaker emits vibrations from the wood to fill the room with a soundscape. compositions are each conceived as a generative system, specifically for pogłos. they intend to live in the background of our lives, setting an atmosphere, decorating our sonic environment.
