## thoughts

background music as an artwork.

it's about the surprise, the unexpected that comes out of the expected. the thing you know, and forgot you were aware of. it's about turning on the music the same way you turn on your favorite light on a coloured spot of the room. maybe like a musical plant.

questions of timing, of spacing, of silence. questions of repetition and resolution (how often does it resolve? does it ever resolve, like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE8gISNPz7I)?). carl stone made [elastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-OHTj4xcgg) (hence symmetrical?) music.

- different modes? (morning, afternoon, night)
- one long-ass soundscape vs. recombinating segments
- how much user control? volume, which composition, but all the way to changing parameters?

## mood

[satoshi ashikawa - still way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f33pvpdXzos) can loop forever

## software

the ideal is to share directly the project file (for instance, `.als` for ableton live, `.maxpat` for max, any source for programming environments), along with all samples used.

## random playback

there is a config at the top of each track directory:
- mode
  - numeric: a given range of seconds to wait between two tracks
  - measure: a given range of proportions of the track length (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)
