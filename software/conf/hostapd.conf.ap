# AP netdevice name (without 'ap' postfix, i.e., wlan0 uses wlan0ap for
# management frames with the Host AP driver); wlan0 with many nl80211 drivers
# Note: This attribute can be overridden by the values supplied with the '-i'
# command line parameter.
interface=wlan0

# In case of atheros and nl80211 driver interfaces, an additional
# configuration parameter, bridge, may be used to notify hostapd if the
# interface is included in a bridge. This parameter is not used with Host AP
# driver. If the bridge parameter is not set, the drivers will automatically
# figure out the bridge interface (assuming sysfs is enabled and mounted to
# /sys) and this parameter may not be needed.
#
# For nl80211, this parameter can be used to request the AP interface to be
# added to the bridge automatically (brctl may refuse to do this before hostapd
# has been started to change the interface mode). If needed, the bridge
# interface is also created.
bridge=br0

# Interface for separate control program. If this is specified, hostapd
# will create this directory and a UNIX domain socket for listening to requests
# from external programs (CLI/GUI, etc.) for status information and
# configuration. The socket file will be named based on the interface name, so
# multiple hostapd processes/interfaces can be run at the same time if more
# than one interface is used.
# /var/run/hostapd is the recommended directory for sockets and by default,
# hostapd_cli will use it when trying to connect with hostapd.
ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd

# Access control for the control interface can be configured by setting the
# directory to allow only members of a group to use sockets. This way, it is
# possible to run hostapd as root (since it needs to change network
# configuration and open raw sockets) and still allow GUI/CLI components to be
# run as non-root users. However, since the control interface can be used to
# change the network configuration, this access needs to be protected in many
# cases. By default, hostapd is configured to use gid 0 (root). If you
# want to allow non-root users to use the contron interface, add a new group
# and change this value to match with that group. Add users that should have
# control interface access to this group.
#
# This variable can be a group name or gid.

# with IEEE 802.11n (HT), too, to specify band). For IEEE 802.11ac (VHT), this
# needs to be set to hw_mode=a. When using ACS (see channel parameter), a

# If CONFIG_ACS build option is enabled, the channel can be selected
# automatically at run time by setting channel=acs_survey or channel=0, both of
