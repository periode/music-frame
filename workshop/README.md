# sound sculpture workshop
===================================

## description
----------------------------

with all the music in the world at the end of our streaming fingertips, it's sometimes hard to think of sounds as something which takes up *space*, something with *weight*, something that can be *built*. and yet, affordable electronics, simple software and cnc machines make it easier than ever to design and construct a musical artefact.

this workshop takes the (very good) excuse of making such a musical artefact to learn the basics of software, hardware, parametric fabrication and sound design, over the course of two days. housed in the zonoteka gallery in neukolln, we will go through all the different steps involved in constructing your own sonified object.

the **electronics** part will include learning the basics of arduino, a hardware prototyping platform, how to connect together a micro-controller, a storage module, an amplifier and an audio exciter. the **software** part will get you introduced to the basics of programming the arduino, in order to program your own playback logic (or, as brian eno would put it, "semi-autonomous generative music"). the **fabrication** component will consist in learning how to design parts on vector software such as illustrator, and how to cut the casing of your object with zonoteka's CNC milling machines, and learning how such a design can arise from programming shapes with parameters, for a unique result. finally, the **sound design** of our object will introduce you to the nitty gritty of audio file formats, and to the craft of writing code to arrange and compose musical sections.
